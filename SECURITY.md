# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please open a private security report with:
- impact summary,
- affected endpoints/files,
- reproduction steps.

If private reporting is not available, avoid posting exploit details publicly and open an issue requesting a secure contact channel.

## Scope notes

This repo is currently a prototype:
- device tokens are basic and not production-grade,
- data is in-memory,
- no multi-tenant isolation yet.

Do not deploy this version to production without hardening.
